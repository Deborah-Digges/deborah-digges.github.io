It's a story I will never tire of telling.</p>\n<p>One late September afternoon, I took my bike down to Christie Pitts park. It was a busy Saturday, as people wanted to catch the last fleeting wisps of summer; I saw a few final attempts at barbecues, a child’s birthday party, and even a man at the piano playing scales. </p>\n<p>I walked behind the piano to observe him and he observed me observing him. I was embarrassed to be caught in the act of people watching in broad daylight.</p>\n<p>“Thanks for the music,” I said, in an effort to save face.</p>\n<p>“Do you play?” </p>\n<p>I told him the story of how I tried to teach myself the piano in the ninth grade and would play the same song over and over, much to the agony of my family.</p>\n<p>After a few more pleasantries, I said goodbye and rested my bike against a tree nearby, planting myself under it, to complete the novel I had been dragging my feet through. As I sat there reading, his music wafted over me. There was something enchanting about it; I remember feeling like I could listen to it all day. I would later learn it was because it was the music of a world famous musician.</p>\n<p>As he walked his bike past me to leave the park, he stopped to chat. </p>\n<p>“Thanks for the music. I enjoyed it,” I said as I put my book aside.</p>\n<p>He set his bike down on the grass and sat beside me; he told me that his mother loved the sound of the piano. He visited her five times a week to play for her. She loved to read, but he’d often find her furiously focusing on a book she was holding upside down. She suffered from dementia.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a different phase of life,” he said, “and no lesser in my eyes.”</p>\n<p>She sometimes spent long afternoons in his studio where he filled notebook after notebook with her likeness. </p>\n<p>“I probably have at least a thousand sketches of her.”</p>\n<p>He flipped open his drawing pad to show me—stacks of fine pencil sketches of his mother sitting across from him at the dining table. I had been learning to draw for a few years by then, and was excited to meet a fellow artist. I couldn’t understand how he created such strong, life-like portraits with just a few carefully placed lines and shapes. I didn’t know then that I would be getting an art lesson from a world famous painter.</p>\n<p>“What would you say the style looks like?” he put the question back to me, as a masterful teacher would.</p>\n<p>“It looks kind of… abstract.”</p>\n<p>“That’s it,” he said, as he elaborated on his process. He made very broad strokes to capture the essence of the subject, not concerning himself with copying what was in front of him, but capturing a feeling. To demonstrate, he drew the scene in front of us, putting it in the context of its surroundings—trees, the path winding around it, and a few people dotting its periphery.</p>\n<p>“Nothing ever exists by itself, it’s all about relationships, whether in art or in music. To evoke the right feeling, you need to create and balance tension between these relationships.”</p>\n<p>We sat there—two strangers in a park, sharing stories. Music was his first love; he started playing when he was nine. He traveled the world and was in a band, Theatre of Hate, famous in the 80s rock scene in England. Music led him to art: one day, when visiting an art gallery in England with his girlfriend at the time, he thought to himself ‘I could be a painter’, and then he did just that. </p>\n<p>“You can check out more of my work at the Roberts Gallery.”</p>\n<p>It hit me. He was an artist of repute, sitting there in the park with a novice, sharing the joy of the craft. I learned that he was John Lennard. </p>\n<p>As he stood up to leave, he tore a page from his drawing pad and gave it to me–a drawing of his aging mother. I was speechless.</p>\n<p>“It’s a gift,” he said, “just don’t show it to the guys down at the Roberts Gallery. I need to run now. I’m off to coach the Varsity Squash Team at the University of Toronto.” </p>\n<p>It turns out that he was also a world class squash player.</p>\n<p>“My squash coach in high school called my mom and told her I had potential. I thought, hey, that’s probably more fun than sitting on the couch and watching TV.“</p>\n<p>And there he went: John Lennard—world famous athlete, musician, and artist, who had just spent an hour in the park teaching a stranger the craft of abstract drawing. What struck me the most about him was his curiosity: he seemed to have more questions about me than I did of him. When I told him about the writing course I’d be doing later that fall, he was more excited than anyone I’ve ever told.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a story to tell, and everyone’s story is valid. What will you write about?”</p>\n<p>I wasn’t sure at the time, but I had a feeling it would be about him. </p>\n<p>He gave me many gifts that afternoon: an expert art lesson, a live musical performance, a piece of art for my apartment, inspiration to improve my craft, but, most of all, a story to tell. It adorns my wall as my sole piece of art—a pencil sketch of John Lennard’s aging mother, a summer trinket.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Wall Art"},"fields":{"date":"2022-12-21","slug":"2022/12/21/First-Wall-Art/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2022/12/21/First-Wall-Art/","date":"2022-12-21"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
