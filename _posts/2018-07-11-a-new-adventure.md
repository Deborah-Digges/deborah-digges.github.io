About a year ago, I completed the Self Driving Car nano-degree program from Udacity where I learnt about computer vision, deep learning, and robotics, and led [a project](https://github.com/tokyo-drift/capstone-project) that navigated a real autonomous vehicle. Overall, it was an enriching learning experience, albeit fraught with difficulty.

This time around, it's time for a new adventure! I've enrolled for the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Program](https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) led by the wonderful [Alexis Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-cook-a6127753/). It's all absolutely new to me and I can't wait to jump right in.

Let the games begin!
