title: "Box of Trinkets"
---

I collect stories as one might collect trinkets: picking them up off city sidewalks and busy park trails, holding them up to the light, and then setting them away someplace safe&mdash;like a jewel box. If anyone asks to see what's inside the box, I throw it open to show off my assorted collection.

"Here's when my heart hurt so much it made no sense to go on, but I did.", I point to a pile that’s bigger than I’d like.

"Here's when I saw a traveling circus in a park, here a writer, and here an artist."

I could go on, but I've lost my audience by now. The box always seems to better captivate them.

I've traveled halfway around the world to find them, but it seems like, these days, they seem to find me. I have no jewels, but would you like to see my trinkets?
